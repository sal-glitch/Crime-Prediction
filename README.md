# Crime-Prediction
## Problem Statement
Increasing Crime rates serve as an important problem in todays society. It would be helpful if police departments were able to learn to predict crimes that have a higher probablity of happening at a particular place in a particular situation. To do this, normal Machine Learning methods are not helpful as these consists of spatio-temporal features. Thus using Deep learning, we can achieve this. 
## Aim: 
To predict the crimes likely to happen in the future from temporal spatial features of previous crimes, using Neural networks built from scratch using just Numpy Library on public Crime dataset based in San Francisco.
## Algorithms/Libraries used:
- Numpy alone
- 1 input layer, 3 hidden layers, 1  output layer
- Adam optimiser 
- ReLu activation function along with sigmoid
- mini batch gradient descent
## Future Scope:
To use LSTMs and recurrent neural networks to be able to train larger networks, with higher efficiency such that more features can be incorporated.
